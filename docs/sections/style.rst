My Style
--------

Maximize ROI
  Focus on value. Leverage your time and money. Use force multipliers. `Do less <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v-TrvLEgPpV8s>`_. Find the `Objectives, Key Results <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR>`_, and `Key Performance Indicator <https://www.klipfolio.com/resources/kpi-examples>`_.

Predict and Delegate
  *"The two most important attributes of effective leaders are their ability to predict and to delegate."* ~ `Verne Harnish <https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Rockefeller-Habits-Increase-Growing/dp/0978774957>`_

Done Is Better Than Perfect
  Perfection takes too long. Iterate `often <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v-jHyU54GhfGs>`_. Keep the `feedback loop <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop>`_ as short as possible. `Disagree and commit <https://www.amazon.jobs/principles>`_ when needed.

Work in Small Blocks of Time
  I break my day into small blocks of time like `Bill Gates and Elon Musk <http://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-elon-musk-scheduling-habit-2017-8>`_. My blocks are 6 minutes long. I fit all my work into multiples of `these blocks <https://gist.github.com/dperuo/f29a48fce8d306140a46e3bbed422ea0>`_.

Schedule Meetings in Advance
  Scheduled all meetings with me in advance. Shorter meetings are better than longer meetings.

Use the Playbook
  When in doubt, consult the :doc:`playbook`.

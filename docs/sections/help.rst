How to Help Me
--------------

Cover the Details
  I move fast and donâ€™t always catch every detail. Please cover the details, and flag me down for details that need my attention.

Raise Issues Early
  If there's a mistake or something is heading off the rails, please tell me before the crash. Failure is great; surprises are not.

Give Me a Reality Check
  I set the bar very high. Please tell me if I'm acting like a dick or being unrealistic about what we can do in the time we have.

Find a Better Way
  I like new ideas and better options. I  `act fast <https://digitalkickstart.com/the-4070-rule-and-how-it-applies-to-you/>`_ and will pivot as needed to move in a different direction.

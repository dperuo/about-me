Core Values
-----------

Do Good Work
  Create “Good Karma” in the universe. You should always feel comfortable telling your mother about what you do and how you do it.

Deliver as Promised
  Say what you mean, mean what you say, don't be mean when you say it. Trust your team to do the same.

Pay It Forward
  Empower others to reach their goals. Spread knowledge fast. Teach others what you know. Learn new things.

Keep It Fun
  Act with kindness and love. Find the joy. Leave people with happy memories.

Take Ownership
  `No blame. No excuses. <https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/never-complain-never-explain/>`_ How you do anything is how you do everything.

Play to Win
  *Winning* is very different than *not losing*. If we're going to play the game, play the game to win. Crush it, every day.

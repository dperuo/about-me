How to Communicate With Me
--------------------------

Be Blunt
  Tell me what I need to know, not what you think I want to hear. Never  `sugarcoat <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sugarcoat>`_ or  `bury the lead <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bury_the_lead#English>`_. I cannot read your mind or second-guess what you're trying to say.

Start at the End
  Put the  `bottom line up front <https://hbr.org/2016/11/how-to-write-email-with-military-precision>`_. Give me the  `TL;DR <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TL;DR>`_. I'll probe for details as I need them.

No Blame, No Excuses
  Say what you mean, mean what you say, `don't be mean when you say it. <https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/never-complain-never-explain/>`_ I will do the same.

Offer Solutions
  Always come to me with good solutions and your recommended plan of action.

Disagree When Needed
  If I say something you disagree with, tell me. I respect people who have the  `confidence <https://www.amazon.jobs/principles>`_ to question their colleagues.

Protect Your Time
  Time is a resource. Know your limits. Don't take on more than you can do in the time you have. Tell me when you are at capacity and when your plate is full.

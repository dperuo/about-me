I Don't Track the Hours You Work
  My focus is on the value we bring to our clients and customers. If you can do that in 30 minutes while sitting on a park bench in Zurich, then do it!

Make Team Communication Easy
  We are a global team and work across a lot of time zones. Please make communication easy. Keep your workday within standard working hours: 7am – 7pm in your time zone. Be clear with your team that you are working between X and Y times and coordinate as needed.

Shift Your Workday as Needed
  You can shift your workday and take time off as needed. Make sure there is no material impact on the needs of your teams, your projects, or the quality of your results.

Don't Work When You're Tired
  I expect high-quality work at all times and this won’t happen at 4 am on five hours of sleep. Talk to your manager to get your workload re-assessed or take time off if you have something going on.

Don't Work on Vacation
  If you are on vacation you should not be working. Take care of yourself and your family. Get some sleep. Eat well. Visit nature and unplug. Work hard when it’s time to work and enjoy the time off when you have time off. This is both healthy for you and keeps scheduling clear and clean with the team.

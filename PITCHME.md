## 1. Our World is Changing

- Name a big, relevant change happening in your prospect’s world
- It must be an undeniable shift that creates both:
    - Big stakes, and
    - Huge urgency for the prospect

---

## 2. There Will be Winners and Losers

- Adapting to the shift will result in a positive future
- Ignoring the shift will result in an unacceptably negative future

---

## 3. Tease the Promised Land

- The happily-ever-after your product helps achieve
- The Promised Land must be:
    - Highly desired by the prospect, and
    - Difficult to achieve without outside help
    - A new future state, not your product
    - Easy for your prospect to repeat internally when you’re not around

---

## 4. Introduce Features as Magic Gifts

- Show how features of your product achieve the transition from “the old world” to “the new world”
- Show why it’s tough to reach the Promised Land with traditional solutions

---

## 5. Present Evidence

- Commit to the prospect that if they go with you, you _will_ get them to the Promised Land
- Present relevant customer success stories
- Failing success stories, show demos
- Present features in the context of getting to the Promised Land
